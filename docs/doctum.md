We use doctum to generate documentation based on phpdoc comments for describing classes and functions.  The views for this framework's api-docs can be found at `resources/views/api-docs`.  The api-docs are accessible locally through the API link in the navbar if you are logged in as an administrator.  Whenever you add more functions to your project the api-docs can be easily be generated by running the following command:

```sh
php console make:api
```

Make sure you use git to add and commit your api-docs so they are under source control for your project.

The configuration file is located under project root and is called `doctum.php`.  The following directories are excluded from being included with api-docs:
1. resoruces/views/api-docs
2. cache
3. config
4. logs
5. node_modules
6. public
7. vendor

## 2. Accessing api-docs <a id="access-api"></a><span style="float: right; font-size: 14px; padding-top: 15px;">[Table of Contents](#table-of-contents)</span>
There are two methods for accessing the api-docs.  Running the following command in the console with optional port and host arguments:

```sh
php console serve:api --port=<port_number> --host=<hostname_or_ip>
```

Then navigate to `http://<hostname_or_ip>:<port_number>`.  The default is `http://localhost:8001`.  If you are using Apache or Nginx you can navigate to `localhost/api-docs/index.html`.
